# Titanic Passenger Survival Prediction

This repository contains code for predicting passenger survival using the Titanic dataset from Kaggle. The goal is to perform binary classification to predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster based on other features.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is the famous Titanic dataset from Kaggle. It contains information about passengers aboard the Titanic, including features such as age, sex, ticket class, fare, cabin, and whether they survived or not.

You can find the dataset on Kaggle [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data).

## Methodology

Binary classification techniques are applied to build a predictive model. Various machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machines (SVM) are explored to find the best model for predicting passenger survival.

## Usage

To run the code locally:

1. Clone this repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/titanic-survival-prediction.git
