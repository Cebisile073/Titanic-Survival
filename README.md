# Titanic Passenger Survival Prediction

This repository contains code for predicting passenger survival using the Titanic dataset from Kaggle. The goal is to perform binary classification to predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster based on other features.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is the famous Titanic dataset from Kaggle. It contains information about passengers aboard the Titanic, including features such as age, sex, ticket class, fare, cabin, and whether they survived or not.

You can find the dataset on Kaggle [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data).

## Methodology

Binary classification techniques are applied to build a predictive model. The Logistic Regression Algorithm is explored to predict passenger survival.

## Usage

To run the code locally:

1. Clone this repository:
git clone https://github.com/cebisile073/titanic-survival-prediction.git

2. Install the required dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt


3. Run the main script:
python predict_survival.py


## Results

The performance of the model is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The model yield 83% Accuracy.
